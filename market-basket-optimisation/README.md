## Association Rule Learning
Association Rules is one of the very important concepts of machine learning being used in market basket analysis. In a store, all vegetables are placed in the same aisle, all dairy items are placed together and cosmetics form another set of such groups. Investing time and resources on deliberate product placements like this not only reduces a customerâ€™s shopping time, but also reminds the customer of what relevant items he might be interested in buying, thus helping stores cross-sell in the process. Association rules help uncover all such relationships between items from huge databases.
It has many applications like "people who bought this also bought" kind of recommendations in e-commerce websites, song recommendations etc.
