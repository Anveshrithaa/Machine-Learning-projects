# customer-purchase-prediction
 A python code to predict if a customer will purchase or not a product on the basis of their salary and age using various classification algorithms like K-NN, Logistic regression, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision tree and randon forest classification.
 
 Comparing the accuracies of differnet models,
 * Linear regression- 89%
 * SVM - 90%
 * Naive Bayes- 90%
 * Random Forest classifier- 92%
 * K-NN - 93%
 * Decision Tree classifier- 91%
 
 Therefore, K-NN model gives the highest accuracy in predicting if the customer will buy the product or not.
